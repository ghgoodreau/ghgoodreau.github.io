I am not usually one for resolutions. I have never actually made one. I find most of them silly and unrealistic. However, I am finding myself in an awkward position this year, so I have decided I am going to try it. As a 23-year-old who works and studies full time, I have found it very easy to fall into a rut and let the days slip by. I have not been enjoying them like I should, and at the same time, I have not been as productive as I should. This list of micro-resolutions should do the trick.

## Preparing to break into the tech industry

I recently completed phase 1 of the Amazon Software Development Engineer Intern online assessment. I use the term "completed" very loosely because I only got 2 out of 7 problems correct. This test focused mainly on debugging simple programs in C, C++, or Java (naturally, I chose Java). Once I pressed 'Begin,' I found myself flustered. I was incredibly nervous, and I was overthinking every problem. Looking back, I knew the answers to all of them. I just didn't have enough time. And that is going to be a problem.

To be fair, I did not expect to get this internship. I just did not expect to be eliminated during the first round. It feels a little bit crushing, but it also points me in the direction of where I need to go. This failure will refocus me. I have thought of three things I can do to help prevent this from happening again.

- Grinding [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

  This is the most straightforward approach to solving coding interview problems. They are organized into difficulty categories so I can progress my way up, and they are in small chunks where I can do them at a nice pace (thinking one a day for now). Most of them rely on extremely important concepts that can translate well into other similar problems, which will give me an edge if I experience something similar in an interview, and I am able to use a similar strategy.

- Reading/working through ['Cracking the Coding Interview'](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)

  This is another straightforward solution. This book is widely known as one of the best ways to prepare for coding interviews. It is featured in Java, my current favorite language, and the one I know the best, and it features an insane amount of problems. It also covers Data Structures and Algorithms, which is HUGELY important for getting a job as a software engineer. This book will prove to be invaluable.

  It has been on my shelf for a month, and I haven't opened it until now. I am hoping to put at least 15 minutes into this book a day.

- Working on passion projects

  This is less straightforward, and I don't have any project ideas. However, this could prove to be more valuable than the other two items. This could cause me to gain specific knowledge in an area of software that I am truly interested in, which could lead me to find more fulfilling opportunities later down the road. This could also lead me to be happier because I would likely enjoy my time more, which leads me to the second resolution that I have...

## Spending more time enjoying myself

As a full-time employee and student, I have honestly been ignoring my mental health pretty severely. I work, I come home, I study, I sleep. I eat whenever I can, and I don't work out. My health has suffered, and so has my mood. But it does not have to be this way. Each day, I have plenty of time to do these essential things.

The most important thing, to me, is to enjoy a little bit of each day doing things that I love. That can mean video games, watching movies, sitting in silence, playing guitar. It doesn't actually matter what I do. The only strict policy I am going to develop here is that I want to do SOMETHING for 30 minutes a day that I don't have to do.

## Working on my fitness

This one is more cliche, but it is necessary. I need to take better care of my body. I do enjoy working out for the record. I just get lost doing my daily routine of working and studying, and then I don't have time. This needs to change.

I recently sprained my wrist while snowboarding in Lake Tahoe and went to the doctor to rule out a fracture by getting an X-Ray. They said my wrist wasn't broken, but that my blood pressure is high. I'm 23 years old. This is unacceptable. Cardio must be done. I am confident I can get it back to normal levels just by working out and consuming less caffeine. I will continue to monitor it while I start my fitness routine.
