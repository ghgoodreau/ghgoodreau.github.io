title: Notes From Quarantine

Due to the Coronavirus pandemic that is currently ravaging the United States, I am working from home and self-isolating until further notice. The only times I have left my apartment in the past week were to go to publix and to go for a run around my neighborhood. This leads to an interesting set of challenges that I have never faced before.

## Staying fit

Staying in my apartment all day working at my desk has presented a challenge in regards to staying fit. I live in a studio, so I barely have to walk to meet all my needs. To stay fit while living this sedentary lifestyle, I have started running with the Nike Run Club app. I input my activity level and all my specs (height, weight, etc). It presented me with a running plan. In the last 5 days, I have run 4.5 miles, which is more than I can say I have run in the past year. This has gotten me moving and has given me the added bonus of an increased mood - it has been incredibly sunny and warm on these runs, and it has been very fun to explore my neighborhood. I think this a new hobby of mine, and I hope to keep it with me.

## Social interaction

Social interaction is a difficult thing to find when you are alone in your apartment. Luckily, I have a bunch of friends across the country that I am able to play games with on discord. This has been fundamental in keeping me sane. Talking to them about their experiences and having fun has been huge for me. I also work with a great team of people and we interact all day through a slack channel. It's not as good as face to face interaction, but it's gotten me through self-isolation so far.

## Staying informed (but not overinformed)

Constantly being inundated with articles and tweets about the pandemic can leave you feeling anxious. Staying informed is important during a time like this, but a constant wave of information and opinions beamed directly into your eyeballs can only do so much before it starts to damage you. I have combated this by limiting my social media use and getting most of my information from detailed updates from my family, friends, and ['The New Paper'](https://www.thenewpaper.co/). This is a daily newsletter with condensed news articles that is sent to your email for free. I love it because I don't have to filter through a bunch of stuff to get the big updates. I'm sure I'm missing stuff, but I've decided to be okay with that.

## Keeping a healthy diet

This has been easier since my favorite thai restaurant nearby closed. Maintaining a balanced diet when you can't leave your house (and when you do, publix has like 5 items) is challenging. It takes a lot of planning. I have luckily been able to meet all my macros because I stocked up early enough. When I am lacking on protein, I make a shake with oat milk and the Syntha-6 I bought off of Amazon recently. I'm not too strict on everything else, I just try to meet my macros and watch my sodium and sugar intake.
