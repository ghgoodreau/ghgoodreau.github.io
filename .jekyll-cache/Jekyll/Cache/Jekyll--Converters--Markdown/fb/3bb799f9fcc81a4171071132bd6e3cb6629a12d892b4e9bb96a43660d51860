I"2<p>Deployed via this <a href="https://github.com/ghgoodreau/ansible_image_gallery">ansible script</a>, this Python/Flask based image gallery web application allows users to upload and view images on our site. With login authentication it ensures the privacy of the userâ€™s information. It is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances in a custom AWS VPC, which we have set up via the Ansible script to load balance and scale if a certain traffic threshold is met. The AWS VPC was set up to ensure security and that nobody outside of certain IP addresses could SSH in.</p>
