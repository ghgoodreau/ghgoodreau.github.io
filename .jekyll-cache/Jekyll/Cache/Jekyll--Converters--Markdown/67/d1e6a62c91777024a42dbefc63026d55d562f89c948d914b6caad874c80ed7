I graduated from <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/">Auburn University</a> in December of 2018 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_sciences">Biomedical Sciences</a>. I am currently pursuing my second bachelorâ€™s degree from Auburn in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer Science</a>, while also working as a full-time software engineer contractor for the Navy.</p>
