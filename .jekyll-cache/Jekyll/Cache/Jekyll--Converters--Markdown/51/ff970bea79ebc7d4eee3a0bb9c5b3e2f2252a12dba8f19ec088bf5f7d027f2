I""<p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.auburn.edu/">Auburn University</a> in December of 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_sciences">Biomedical Sciences</a>. I am currently pursuing my second bachelor’s degree from Auburn in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer Science</a>, while also working full time.</p>

<p>I am slated to graduate in the spring of 2021. My goal is to continue through a master’s degree in Computer Science and to work on exciting and challenging problems. I believe that the field of computer science contains limitless possibilities, so it is the path that I have chosen.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while I continue my studies, I am seeking an internship/co-op (or a full-time job) where I can work hands-on with new technologies, contribute to a valuable product, and learn all the lessons that I can.</p>
