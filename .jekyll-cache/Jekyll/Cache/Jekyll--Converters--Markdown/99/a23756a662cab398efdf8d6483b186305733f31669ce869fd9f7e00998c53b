I"_<p>Due to the Coronavirus pandemic that is currently ravaging the United States, I am working from home and self-isolating until further notice. The only times I have left my apartment in the past week were to go to publix and to go for a run around my neighborhood. This leads to an interesting set of challenges that I have never faced before.</p>
