I"%<p>This workout tracker was inspired by my inability to go to the gym due to COVID-19. I felt the need to make a simple terminal application for when I am able to get back to working out. All of the mobile apps I have tried are overengineered and complicated, and I find myself using 0.5% of their capabilities. This records maxes for OHP, Squats, Deadlifts, Bench, Chinups, and Rows, and exports them into a csv for statistical tracking.
