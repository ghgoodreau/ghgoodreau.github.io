I"O<p>I am not typically one for resolutions at the start of a new year. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2018/12/31/goals-not-resolutions/">Some reports</a> say that up to 80% of new year’s resolutions don’t get accomplished. With that being said… here is a list of changes I am making this year.</p>

<!--end-excerpt-->

<h2 id="preparing-to-break-into-the-tech-industry">Preparing to break into the tech industry</h2>

<p>I recently completed phase 1 of the Amazon Software Development Engineer Intern online assessment. I use the term “completed” very loosely because I only got 2 out of 7 problems 100% correct. This test focused mainly on debugging simple programs in C, C++, or Java (naturally, I chose Java). Once I pressed ‘Begin,’ I found myself flustered. I was incredibly nervous, and I was overthinking every problem. Looking back, I knew the answers to all of them. I just didn’t have enough time. And that is going to be a problem.</p>

<p>To be fair, I did not expect to get this internship. I just did not expect to be eliminated during the first round. It feels bad, but it also points me in the direction of where I need to go. It reocused me. I have thought of three things I can do to help prevent this from happening again.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Grinding <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a></p>

    <p>This is the most straightforward approach to solving coding interview problems. They are organized into difficulty categories so I can progress my way up, and they are in small chunks where I can do them at a nice pace (thinking one a day for now). Most of them rely on extremely important concepts that can translate well into other similar problems, which will give me an edge if I experience something similar in an interview, and I am able to use a similar strategy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading/working through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850">‘Cracking the Coding Interview’</a></p>

    <p>This is another straightforward solution. This book is widely known as one of the best ways to prepare for coding interviews. It is featured in Java, my current favorite language, and the one I know the best, and it features an insane amount of problems. It also covers Data Structures and Algorithms, which is HUGELY important for getting a job as a software engineer. This book will prove to be invaluable.</p>

    <p>It has been on my shelf for a month, and I haven’t opened it until now. I am hoping to put at least 15 minutes into this book a day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working on passion projects</p>

    <p>This is less straightforward. However, this could prove to be more valuable than the other two items. This could cause me to gain specific knowledge in an area of software that I am truly interested in, which could lead me to find more fulfilling opportunities later down the road. I could also end up creating something that can actually help people.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spending-more-time-enjoying-myself">Spending more time enjoying myself</h2>

<p>As a full-time employee and student, I have been ignoring time for self care. I work, I come home, I study, I sleep. I eat whenever I can, and I don’t work out. My mood has surely suffered because of this, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Every day, I have plenty of time to do things that I want to do.</p>

<p>The most important thing to me is to enjoy a little bit of each day doing things that I love. That can mean video games, watching movies, sitting in silence, playing guitar. It doesn’t actually matter what I do. The only policy is that for 30 minutes every day, there is no policy. I will allow myself to do what I want to do.</p>

<h2 id="working-on-my-fitness">Working on my fitness</h2>

<p>This one is more cliche, but it is necessary. I need to take better care of my body. I do enjoy working out, but I have been letting my work and school take over my life and I have not had enough energy to get good workouts in. I need to change this, because working out genuinely makes me happy and I want to live a long, healthy life.</p>
