title: About Me
---

I graduated from [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/) in December of 2018 with a bachelor's degree in [Biomedical Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_sciences). I am currently pursuing my second bachelor's degree from Auburn in [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), while also working full time.


I am slated to graduate in the spring of 2021. My goal is to continue through a master's degree in Computer Science and to work on exciting and challenging problems. I believe that the field of computer science contains limitless possibilities, so it is the path that I have chosen.


In the meantime, while I continue my studies, I am seeking an internship/co-op (or a full-time job) where I can work hands-on with new technologies, contribute to a valuable product, and learn all the lessons that I can.


Some languages I have been working with:

- Java
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- C#

Hobbies:

- Flying (I am a student pilot)
- Running
- Cooking
- Video games
- Listening to audiobooks
