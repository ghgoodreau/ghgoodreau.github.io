title: About Me
---

I graduated from [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/) in December of 2018 with a bachelor's degree in [Biomedical Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_sciences). I am currently pursuing my second bachelor's degree from Auburn in [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), while also working full time.


I am slated to graduate in the spring of 2021. My goal is to continue through a master's degree in Computer Science and to work on exciting and challenging problems. I believe that the field of computer science contains limitless possibilities, so it is the path that I have chosen.


In the meantime, while I continue my studies, I am seeking an internship (or a full-time job) where I can work hands-on with new technologies and absorb everything I can.


Some fun facts about me:

- I am a student pilot.
- Seeing a [good movie](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/uncut_gems) at the theater is one of my favorite things to do.
- I am an avid international backpacker.
- I still want to be an astronaut.
- I love [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion).
- I was eliminated in the final round of an elementary school spelling bee because I misspelled buffet. I still think about it.


Some languages I have been working with:

- Java
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- R/RStudio
