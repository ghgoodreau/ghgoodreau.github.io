Hey! I'm Gregory Hunter Goodreau. You can call me Hunter.

I graduated from [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/) in December of 2018 with a bachelor's degree in [Biomedical Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_sciences). I am currently pursuing my second bachelor's degree from Auburn in [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), while also working as a full-time software engineer contractor for the Navy.
