<br/>
<br/>
I graduated from Auburn University in December of 2018 with a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences. I am currently pursuing my second bachelor's degree from Auburn University in Computer Science, while also working full time.


I am slated to graduate in the spring of 2021. My goal is to continue through a master's degree in Computer Science and to work on exciting and challenging problems. I believe that the field of computer science contains limitless possibilities, so it is the path that I have chosen.


In the meantime, while I continue my studies, I am seeking an internship (or a full-time job) where I can work hands-on with new technologies and absorb everything I can.


Some fun facts about me: 

- I am a student pilot. 
- I am an avid international backpacker. 
- Seeing a good movie at the theater is one of my favorite things to do. 
- I love video games. 
- I still want to be an astronaut. 
- I drink two cups of coffee a day, but I'm trying to cut back.


Some technologies I have been working with: 

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Java
