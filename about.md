Hey! I'm Hunter Goodreau.

I'm a full-stack engineer at [Zoom](https://zoom.us), concentrating on front-end development. I mainly write in Typescript/React for the [Zoom Events](https://events.zoom.us) platform. Currently, I'm focused on increasing platform stability through unit testing and providing an excellent user experience by iterating upon and implementing new features.

I graduated from [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/) in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), during which I worked full time. I also hold a bachelor's degree in [Biomedical Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_sciences), which was my first passion.

I'm located in Florida, though I'll be relocating to Chicago in the next few months. I am passionate about flying, video games (including indie development), [film](https://letterboxd.com/hgoood/), and recently, web3.0. I love making new friends, so please reach out if you share my interests!
